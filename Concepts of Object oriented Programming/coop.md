### Core Concepts

#### 1: The Object Model
In every OOP language, **a software system is a set of cooperating objects**, which **exchange messages**. In the figure below, two objects `obj1`and `obj2` can be seen exchanging a message, in the form of a *function call*.
Every object has:
- State
- Identity
- Lifecycle
- Location
- Behavior
